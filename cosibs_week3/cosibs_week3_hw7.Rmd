##### Discuss the results from Homeworks 3 through 6.

In summary, homeworks 3 and 4 had a sample population of 10, while homeworks 5 and 6 had a sample population of 30. Furthermore, homeworks 3 and 5 had a two-sided significance level of 0.05, while homeworks 4 and 6 had a two-sided significance level of 0.01. 

<br/>

The proportion of conclusions that DID NOT reject null hypothesis was highest in Homework 4 (0.7058, n = 10, $\alpha$=0.01), followed by Homework 3 (0.4368, n = 10, $\alpha$=0.05), followed by Homework 6 (0.1151, n = 30, $\alpha$=0.01), and least in Homework 5 (0.033, n = 30, $\alpha$=0.05). These results are expected and correspond with their respective sample size and significance level.
